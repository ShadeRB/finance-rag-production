🔍 **From Financial Reports to Intelligent Answers: How ML Powers AI Product Strategy**

If you've ever tried to extract insights from a 100+ page annual report, you know it's no small task. Now imagine building an AI system that reads it, understands it, and answers your questions accurately—instantly.

That's the power of combining machine learning, data strategy, and LLMs to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

## Project Overview

This project uses Tesla's 10-K SEC filing as a test case to build a production-ready pipeline that lets users ask natural language questions and get fact-grounded answers pulled directly from the source document.

## 🛠️ RAG Pipeline Architecture

Our pipeline follows these core steps:

1. **Ingest financial documents** (like PDFs from SEC filings)
2. **Chunk and embed** those documents into a vector store (e.g., ChromaDB)  
3. **Use a retriever** to fetch relevant chunks when a user asks a question
4. **Combine that with a language model** (like GPT-4) to generate natural language answers, grounded in the retrieved context

We tested this with Tesla's 10-K (sample_10k.pdf) to simulate real use cases like:
- "What are Tesla's main revenue segments?"
- "Which states provided Tesla with tax incentives in 2021?"
- "What new vehicle models are in Tesla's pipeline?"

## 🔍 ML/DS Concepts Behind the Scenes

| ML/DS Concept | Role in Your RAG Pipeline | Example in Tesla 10-K Use |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Preprocessing | Clean and chunk large documents | Break Tesla's 120+ page PDF into semantically meaningful pieces |
| Embeddings | Convert chunks into searchable vectors | Use OpenAI or HuggingFace embeddings to map SEC paragraphs |
| Similarity Search | Find the most relevant chunks per query | Match "What are Tesla's products?" to the right section |
| Model Orchestration | Feed relevant chunks into GPT-4 or similar model | Model uses retrieved content to ground the answer |

## 📈 Strategic Product Vision

This isn't just an AI experiment—it's a future-facing product strategy:

- **Empower finance teams, legal analysts, or investors** to interact with dense documents without manual scanning
- **Build domain-specific assistants** that can reason over long-form, regulated content
- **Deliver explainable, document-grounded responses**—crucial in high-stakes environments like banking, compliance, and insurance
- **Enable business leaders** to ask questions in plain English and trust the answers come directly from verifiable sources

This is how machine learning, AI engineering, and data architecture come together to fuel strategic innovation.

## 🧠 Organizational Strategic Vision

As demonstrated through this project, AI strategy isn't about picking the latest model. It's about orchestrating the right data, retrieval method, and model behavior to deliver business value.

**Key Principles:**
- It's not about replacing people
- It's about elevating decision-making by making knowledge accessible—securely, reliably, and fast
- Focus on building trustworthy AI systems that provide verifiable, source-grounded responses
- Enable seamless human-AI collaboration in high-stakes business environments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required dependencies (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShadeRB/finance-rag-production.git
cd finance-rag-production

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

### Usage

The application runs a Flask server that accepts POST requests to `/query`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are Tesla'\''s main business risks?"}' \
  http://localhost:5001/query
```
